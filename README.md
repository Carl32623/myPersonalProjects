ATM Project
This is a basic program that mimics the interface of an ATM.  New users may be created along with the creation of unique userId's and pin #'s.  The user may login to the system, deposit money into an account, withdraw money from an account, and transfer money from one account to the other.  The user is also given the option to view past transactions made.
